LaTeX template for [UBC Thesis](https://www.grad.ubc.ca/current-students/dissertation-thesis-preparation/structure-theses-dissertations).

- `main.tex` dictates the order of the components and the format of the title page. The table of contents, list of tables, and list of figures are generated for you, but the list of illustrations is not (and you will need to set this up if you have illustrations in your thesis).

## Components
- `abstract.tex`
- `preface.tex`
